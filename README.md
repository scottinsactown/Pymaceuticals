Analysis of potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Compares the data of four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo).

* Created a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
* Created a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic sites changes over time for each treatment.
* Created a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment.
* Created a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
* Includes observations about the results of the study based on the available dataset.
